Tutorial on how to play;
 The first player and computer have a toss in which the player has to choose whether he likes odd or even.
 Then each player and computer pick a number from 0 to 6 (both inclusive) 
 If the sum of the chosen numbers is the same as the player's choice of toss, then the player gets to choose between either score or defend
 The scorer tries to gain as much as points as possible, and the defender attempts to find the scorers gameplan and tries to take his wicket
 if the defender manages to take the wicket, then the roles are reversed
 The game ends if the second scorer manages to beat the score of his predecessor or if the second defender manages to take his wicket before he does so
 Scoring and Taking wicket
 -------------------------
 The players will be prompted to chose a number from 0 to 6, both inclusive for each round
 if the numbers are equal, the wicket is taken by the defender, and roles are switched(if it was the first stage)
 if numbers are not equal, then the number shown by the scorer is added to his point
 if the scorer chose zero and the defender some non zero number, then the defender's number will be added to the scorer's score
 if the defender chose zero, then play continues without any event provided the scorer had chosen a non zero number
